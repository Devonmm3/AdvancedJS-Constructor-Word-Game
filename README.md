# AdvancedJS-Constructor-Word-Game

This game uses the command line for the user input, as he or she guesses different football team letter by letter.  When you guess the letter correctly, your score goes up so you can win the game.  If you miss enough guesses, your score will decrease and ultimately you will lose.  This game uses inquirer and prompt npm packages.
